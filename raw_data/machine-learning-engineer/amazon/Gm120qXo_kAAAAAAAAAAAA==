Our team works on challenging and high-impact projects, including allocating resources to complete millions of orders a day, coordinating the motion of thousands of robots, autonomous navigation in warehouses, and learning how to grasp all the products Amazon sells.\n\nThe internship will be hosted by Movement Science, one of RAD's four research teams. The focus of the work will be on motion planning and coordination of mobile robots, with the overarching goal of improving the efficiency of robot movement. Relevant research topics include combinatorial search, motion planning, scheduling, temporal constraint reasoning, planning under uncertainty, graph theory, queuing theory, and machine learning.\n\nWe have a wide range of open research questions and will match the successful candidate to a problem which corresponds with their strengths and interests. We are looking for a PhD student interested in motion planning and coordination problems for large-scale multi-robot systems, whose research work so far has demonstrated an innovative approach to a specific field of robotics planning. The successful candidate should be capable of diving deep into hard technical problems, and interested in finding solutions that enable successful products.\n\nKey job responsibilities\n\u2022 Gain an understanding of current industrial practice and of existing opportunities for optimization\n\u2022 Develop a new algorithm and/or apply machine learning methods to solve a challenging multi-robot planning and coordination problem\n\u2022 Implement and test your methods using one of our simulators and iterate with your mentor to find the best solutions to the problem\n\u2022 Communicate your research plan, progress and results to the Movement Science team and RAD\nAbout the team\nLearn more about Amazon Robotics\n\nAre you inspired by invention? Is problem solving through teamwork in your DNA? Do you like the idea of seeing how your work impacts the bigger picture? Answer yes to any of these and you'll fit right in here at Amazon Robotics. We are a dedicated team of doers who work passionately to apply cutting edge advances in robotics and software to solve real-world challenges that will transform our customers' experiences. We are Amazon Robotics and we will give you the tools and support you need to invent with us in ways that are rewarding, fulfilling, and fun.\n\nAmazon Robotics empowers a smarter, faster, more consistent customer experience through automation. Amazon Robotics automates its operations using various methods of robotic technology including computer vision, object recognition, autonomous mobile robots, sophisticated control software, power management, machine learning, semantic understanding of commands, automated task planning, motion planning, optimization and multi-robot coordination. Amazon Robotics has a dedicated focus on research and development to continuously explore new opportunities to extend its product lines into new areas.\n\nAmazon Robotics internship/co-op/full-time opportunities will be based out of the Greater Boston Area in our two state-of-the-art facilities in Westborough, MA and North Reading, MA. Both campuses provide a unique opportunity to have direct access to robotics testing labs and manufacturing facilities.\n\nBASIC QUALIFICATIONS\n\u2022 Currently in a PhD program in Computer Science, Engineering, Operations Research, Math, Statistics or related fields with a graduation date after August 2023\n\u2022 Must be eligible and available for a full-time (40 hours per week) internship for at least 12 weeks in the summer of 2023\n\u2022 At least one year of relevant academic research in state-of-the-art approaches for at least one of combinatorial optimization, planning, scheduling, machine learning\n\u2022 At least one published paper (or publicly available pre-print)\n\u2022 Experience implementing algorithms using both toolkits and self-developed code\n\u2022 Experience with programming languages such as Java, C++, Python\n\nPREFERRED QUALIFICATIONS\n\u2022 Scientific mindset and the ability to invent, excellent creative problem solving skills\n\u2022 Superior communication and data presentation skills\n\u2022 Ability to develop system prototypes in simulation, including prior use of Java or C++ for research algorithm development\n\u2022 Demonstrated ability to work on collaborative, cross-functional teams\n\u2022 Drive to see a project through from research concept to working simulation prototype\n\u2022 Working knowledge of analysis of algorithms and computational complexity\nAmazon is committed to a diverse and inclusive workplace.
