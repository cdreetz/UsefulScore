And work on something that does more than fine-tune better advertising\n\nWell, come and join the team at TURNto.ai, where all that is missing is our AI technical talent (and perhaps our venture capital).\n\nIntrigued yet?\n\nSo what can we offer? Other than our very valuable (ahem) equity? Well, there is a technical challenge to sink your teeth into that could help millions of chronically ill people, and a chance to lead the team and the ML roadmap. And if you are interested in the sexy stuff, hypothesising and testing novel models across varied types of data, clever coding vs brute processing strength, and the possibility of entrepreneurial mountain tops, then this could be for you.\n\nWho are we looking for? Well two engineers actually (greedy yes). One who is well versed in building NLP models and the other a more general engineer guru. Familiar in all the relevant languages,\n\nBoth need to like to solve problems, fail fast (sorry we couldn\u2019t help ourselves), have tenacity and curiosity, have initiative initiative initiative (did we mention initiative?), and enjoy work meetings during mountain walks (ok there might be some flexibility here\u2026.maybe).\n\nWho are we? A thriving team (or at least a few people) who are experts in a huge gap in our health system. We love hard problems and are led by creativity, mission-centred, serious about diversity leading deep learning, and dreamers of curing our kids' diseases (yes this is very personal and did we start a company to solve our own problem? Maybe).\n\nAny actual helpful technical information? This platform involves building and implementing advanced ML models, researching, developing and evaluating NLP extraction and interpretation models of medical structured and unstructured data, developing inference models for evidence synthesis, automatic summarisation in plain English, creating models for real time infographics, and using ML to automatically classify and interpret multiple data types. So yeah, both roles are involved in leading and implementing parts of this build (with more members in the development team- phew!).\n\nSpecific proficiencies in a deep learning frameworks (eg. Tensorflow, Pytorch, or Keras), coding, NLP and relevant tools such as huggingface, with Python and other relevant languages, and working with relevant basic libraries for machine learning are essential.\n\nSo now you are definitely intrigued. Am I right? If so, then send us an email to: jess@turnto.ai\n\nTurnto.ai focuses on Healthcare, Health Care Information Technology, Artificial Intelligence, Personal Health, and Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning. Their company has offices in Australia and United States. They have a small team that's between 1-10 employees.\n\nYou can view their website at http://www.turnto.ai/ or find them on LinkedIn"
