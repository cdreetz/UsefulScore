    "description": "Reality Labs at Meta is seeking Research Scientists with experience in product-focused machine learning and signal processing research to advance our pioneering work in neuromotor interfaces, which has grown out of the acquisition of CTRL-labs. We\u2019re building a practical interface drawing on the rich neuromotor signals that can be measured non-invasively via surface electromyography (EMG) with single motor neuron resolution. This technology could become one of the main pillars for interaction with virtual and augmented worlds. We are a multi-disciplinary team of researchers investigating the nature of human neuromotor signals, developing novel signal processing and machine learning methods to infer a user\u2019s intent, and creating novel interaction techniques and user experiences. Help us unleash human potential by removing the bottlenecks between user intent and action.\nRequired Skills\nResearch Scientist, Neuromotor Interfaces Responsibilities:\n\u2022 Plan and execute cutting-edge applied research to advance neuromotor interface capabilities.\n\u2022 Design experiments to collect neuromotor and interaction data and evaluate human and model performance.\n\u2022 Collaborate with engineering and Human-Computer Interactions (HCI) teams to deploy models that leverage fundamental scientific knowledge into new technology and user experiences.\n\u2022 Use quantitative research methods to define, iterate upon, and advance key areas of our research agenda.\n\u2022 Set technical direction for a project of 2-3 researchers and engineers.\nMinumum Qualification\nMinimum Qualifications:\n\u2022 Currently has, or is in the process of obtaining a PhD, in systems neuroscience, computational neuroscience, machine learning, biophysics, electrical engineering, computer science, statistics, or related fields.\n\u2022 Must obtain work authorization in country of employment at the time of hire, and maintain ongoing work authorization during employment.\n\u2022 Research-oriented software engineering skills, including fluency with libraries for scientific computing (e.g. SciPy ecosystem).\n\u2022 Proficiency with quantitative methods (mathematics, statistics) and experience acquiring new technical knowledge and skills rapidly.\nPreferred Qualification\nPreferred Qualifications:\n\u2022 5+ years of experience working autonomously to design, execute, interpret, and present research studies.\n\u2022 2+ years of experience as technical lead for a project of 2-3 individuals.\n\u2022 Experience in the analysis and modeling of high dimensional time series, such as neural signals, other physiological signals, audio recordings, robotic sensory signals, financial time series, video, or other sensor modalities.\n\u2022 Experience in deep learning or probabilistic graphical models. Fluency with libraries for deep learning and machine learning (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn).\n\u2022 Experience with scientific communication tools (jupyter, matplotlib).\n\u2022 Experience in software engineering in industry.\n\u2022 Experience bringing machine learning-based products from research to production.\n\nMeta is proud to be an Equal Employment Opportunity and Affirmative Action employer.
