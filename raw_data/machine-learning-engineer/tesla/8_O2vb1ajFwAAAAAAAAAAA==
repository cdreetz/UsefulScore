    "description": "What To Expect\n\nThe Role\n\nTesla is on a path to build humanoid bi-pedal robots at scale to automate repetitive and boring tasks for manufacturing/logistics. Core to the Tesla Bot, the deep learning stack presents a unique opportunity to work on state-of-the-art neural network algorithms for deep learning culminating in their deployment to real world production applications. Our deep learning research scientists and engineers develop and own this stack from inception to deployment.\n\nResponsibilities\n\nWhat You\u2019ll Do\n\u2022 Train machine learning and deep learning models on a computing cluster to perform visual recognition tasks, such as segmentation and detection\n\u2022 Develop state-of-the-art algorithms in one or all of the following areas: deep learning (convolutional neural networks), object detection/classification, tracking, multi-task learning, large-scale distributed training, multi-sensor fusion, dense depth estimation, etc.\n\u2022 Optimize deep neural networks and the associated preprocessing/postprocessing code to run efficiently on an embedded device\n\nRequirements\n\nWhat You\u2019ll Bring\n\nThe team operates in a production setting. An ideal candidate has strong software engineering practices and is very comfortable with Python programming, debugging/profiling, and version control.\n\u2022 We train neural networks on a cluster in large-scale distributed settings. An ideal candidate is very comfortable in cluster environments and understands the related computer systems concepts (CPU/GPU interactions/transfers, latency/throughput bottlenecks during training of neural networks, CUDA, pipelining/multiprocessing, etc).\n\u2022 We are at the cutting edge of deep learning applications. The ideal candidate has a strong understanding of the under the hood fundamentals of deep learning (layer details, backpropagation, etc). Additional requirements include the ability to read and implement related academic literature and experience in applying state of the art deep learning models to computer vision (e.g. segmentation, detection) or a closely related area (speech, NLP).\n\u2022 Experience with PyTorch, or at least another major deep learning framework such as TensorFlow\n\u2022 Some experience with data science tools including Python scripting, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, jupyter notebooks, bash scripting, Linux environment.\n\nBenefits\n\nAlong with competitive pay, as a full-time Tesla employee, you are eligible for the following benefits at day 1 of hire:\n\u2022 Aetna PPO and HSA plans > 2 medical plan options with $0 payroll deduction\n\u2022 Family-building, fertility, adoption and surrogacy benefits\n\u2022 Dental (including orthodontic coverage) and vision plans, both have options with a $0 paycheck contribution\n\u2022 Company Paid (Health Savings Account) HSA Contribution when enrolled in the High Deductible Aetna medical plan with HSA\n\u2022 Healthcare and Dependent Care Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA)\n\u2022 LGBTQ+ care concierge services\n\u2022 401(k) with employer match, Employee Stock Purchase Plans, and other financial benefits\n\u2022 Company paid Basic Life, AD&D, short-term and long-term disability insurance\n\u2022 Employee Assistance Program\n\u2022 Sick and Vacation time (Flex time for salary positions), and Paid Holidays\n\u2022 Back-up childcare and parenting support resources\n\u2022 Voluntary benefits to include: critical illness, hospital indemnity, accident insurance, theft & legal services, and pet insurance\n\u2022 Weight Loss and Tobacco Cessation Programs\n\u2022 Tesla Babies program\n\u2022 Commuter benefits\n\u2022 Employee discounts and perks program\n\nExpected Compensation\n\n$104,000 - $348,000/annual salary + cash and stock awards + benefits\n\nPay offered may vary depending on multiple individualized factors, including market location, job-related knowledge, skills, and experience. The total compensation package for this position may also include other elements dependent on the position offered. Details of participation in these benefit plans will be provided if an employee receives an offer of employment"
