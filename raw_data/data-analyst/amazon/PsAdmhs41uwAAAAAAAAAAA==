    "description": "SCOT Network Topology science team focuses on research areas and tools that determine Amazon outbound network design as we transition to relying on our internal carrier network and accelerate one-day delivery speed. There are various strategic questions the team is attempting to answer, such as: what is the impact of placement on outbound cost and delivery speed? What is the optimal network design given capacity constraints? How can we forecast accurately fulfillment pattern for different customer clusters?. If you are interested in diving into a multi-discipline, high impact space this team is for you. So far, we utilized models from various science disciplines such as: Mixed Integer , Random Forest (or other ML techniques), /probabilistic model, economic analysis, to name a few.\n\nIn addition to network, we also use and techniques to evaluate new facilities recommendation for long term estimates, We use to approximate the network, and simulation of how our choices will perform. The team is a mixture of Software Engineers, Operations Research Scientists, Applied Scientists, Business Intelligence Engineers and Product Managers.\n\nWe are looking for a Sr. Research Scientist who has a knowledge of analyzing fulfillment data using and . Those who are strong in space should have a breadth of other ML experience in a production environment using techniques. This role will focus on expanding our reach to analyze various fulfillment and for Amazon's network worldwide.\n\nBASIC QUALIFICATIONS\n\u2022 PhD in a quantitative field such as Mathematics, Statistics, Physics, Engineering, Computer Science, , Economics and 5+ years of industry experience OR MS or greater in a quantitative field and 9+ years of experience (after graduation)\n\u2022 Strong coding and problem-solving skills in at least one programming such as Python, Java, SQL, etc.\n\u2022 Familiar with AWS environment, such as S3, Sage Maker and other\n\u2022 Experience with linear or model to make big-impact decision making. Familiar with using CPLEX/XPRESS/Gurobi\n\u2022 Sound theoretical understanding of broad concepts, with and demonstrable expertise in at least one topic or application of .\n\nPREFERRED QUALIFICATIONS\n\u2022 Experience with fully automated training (e.g. automatic re-training, automatic testing) on techniques such as Random Forest, Regression (Linear), Time-Series (ARIMA) and Neural network (LSTM, CNN) using 1+GB datasets.\n\u2022 Experience with high-impact decisions (> $50M)\n\u2022 Experience with in production, providing bridging decisions and explanation of models and its impact\n\u2022 Experience with consulting senior management on benefits of new design based economic ROI analysis using techniques.\n\u2022 Experience building model using XPRESS/Mosel, Gurobi or CPLEX. Fine tuning and designing complex mathematical problem into various decomposition algorithm.\n\u2022 Experience writing production-quality code using collaborative process such as Git and AWS"
