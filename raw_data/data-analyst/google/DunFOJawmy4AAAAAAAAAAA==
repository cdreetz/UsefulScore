In this role i need to analyze and also summarize/present a lot of data.\n\nIdeally i want to find a skilled person who can be flexible and perform on a short term notice. This could lead to as a more fixed income position as an executive assistant\n\nI have a first task involving a set of data.\n\nI have a sheet of +300 lines and different data in 6-12 columns. In this task i need to be able to find the latest entry from the column matching the line data. Its most likely simple for someone skilled on excel/google sheet.\n\nIf you have any experience in supply chain that is a major plus"
