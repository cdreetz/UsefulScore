    "description": "What to Expect\n\nThe Residential Energy Installation Process Engineering team is responsible for architecting and deploying processes, data pipelines, predictive/causal inference models, and data applications that optimize installation of Solar Roof, Retrofit PV, and Powerwall products. This is one of the most cross-functional and high visibility teams in Tesla Energy, owning technical and non-technical deliverables for design engineering, material planning and fulfillment, scheduling software, and field operations teams. Elon has said Tesla is a whole chain of startups. We are one of these, and you will be expected to take on a diverse range of responsibilities accordingly. You will be asked to independently drive end-to-end ownership of technical and non-technical deliverables; generally, 1-2 month projects deploying production applications with significant business impact. These require a broad range of skills including data engineering, data science, machine learning engineering, process/systems engineering, and software engineering.\n\nWhat You\u2019ll Do\n\nThis full-stack role crosses significant functional and product lines, supporting all Tesla residential energy product lines including Solar PV, Powerwall, and Solar Roof. A highly-technical, curious, and organized individual is needed to thrive in this role. You need to care more about solving problems than the particular tools used to solve them. Example projects may include:\n\u2022 Labor hours model training and deployment\n\u2022 Installation process and scheduling optimization\n\u2022 Leveraging installer location data to inform task execution and automation\n\u2022 Causal inference analyses for product pricing\n\u2022 Supply chain/material flow demand modeling to inform part ordering and inventory management\n\u2022 Ad-hoc data analysis to inform design engineering product development\n\u2022 A/B testing customer-facing communications, modeling behavior impact\n\nWhat You\u2019ll Bring\n\u2022 Programming Languages: Python, SQL, R\n\u2022 Tools: Git, Python IDE (VSCode, PyCharm), Atlassian (Jira, Confluence), Excel\n\u2022 Strong experience with machine learning operations and pipeline deployment, including requirement gathering and constructing clean, feature engineered datasets\n\u2022 Experience gathering and processing raw, structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data using batch and real-time data processing frameworks\n\u2022 Strong experience working with relational databases (Vertica, MSSQL, MySQL, PostgreSQL)\n\u2022 Significant exposure to data science and data engineering best practices (code quality)\n\u2022 Proactively identify improvement opportunities (potential gaps between process and system) across all business functions, developing tools that allow for visibility into process bottlenecks and inconsistencies\n\u2022 Technical project management experience driving independent and collaborative initiatives from problem definition to sustained deployment\n\u2022 Experience learning/documenting systems architecture to deploy standard processes and communicate cross-functional needs\n\u2022 Preferred Data/Systems Engineer Job Description 3 B.S./M.S. in Computer Science, Data Engineering, Data Science, Software Engineering, Mathematics, Physics"
