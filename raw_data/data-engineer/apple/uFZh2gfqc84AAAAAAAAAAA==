You\u2019ll have the unique opportunity to contribute to the development and continuing improvement of Apple hardware products by distilling data into actionable and intuitive visualizations from human interaction perspective. As an Austin-based team member, you will collaborate closely with Cupertino-based cross-functional team members.\n\nKey Qualifications\n\nKey Qualifications\n\u2022 Candidates must be able to work independently and excel in a dynamic, hands-on, cross-functional and creative corporate environment. Ideal candidates will possess an energetic personality with excellent communication and interpersonal skills, attention to detail, patience, and aesthetic sensibility.\n\u2022 This position requires strong programming skills in Python with experience working with multivariate datasets to import, clean, analyze and visualize data to enable data-driven decisions. Knowledge of population studies, dimensionality reduction, and and big data analysis is desired. Datasets include human anthropometric and biometric data as well as user study research data.\n\u2022 Ideal candidates have experience analyzing and visualizing data sets in prediction and probabilistic models (e.g., Bayesian network models, Markov random field models). Candidates are enthusiastic about delving deeper into 3D data analysis and visualization. Most importantly, a great passion for creating informative visualizations and presentations to communicate results to all levels of the company.\n\nDescription\n\nDescription\nAs a member of this team-oriented, collaborative group, you will be working on the latest, most innovative Apple products together with many cross-functional teams.\nYour responsibilities will include the following activities:\nWrite scripts to pre-process data from various sources and formats.\nProcess, clean, and verify the integrity of data. Investigate new sources that can extend and improve insights.\nConduct data exploration on datasets, QA/QC, visualization, statistical and data analyses, and mathematical modeling.\nCreate custom visualizations that help decision makers quickly understand the data.\nCollaborate with cross-functional teams to help identify trends in their data or to build tools that will enable easier analysis and visualizations in the future.\n\nThe role will require close collaboration with human factor design engineers, computer vision scientists, data scientists, and product engineers with many opportunities to practice and grow communication skills. You\u2019ll have a lot of latitude to define how you work; specific tools matter less than the lateral thinking they enable. This is a truly unique opportunity that exposes you to many different teams at Apple.\n\nEducation & Experience\n\nEducation & Experience\nMasters degree in an analytical field such as (but not limited to) Computer Science, Engineering, Statistics, Applied Math, Physics, Biological Sciences, Robotics, Climate or Environmental Science, along with 2+ years relevant work experience.
